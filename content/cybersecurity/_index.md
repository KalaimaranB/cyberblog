⚡ My journey into cybersecurity started quite by chance - after hearing about it from a couple of my friends I thought I'd explore. I started with just doing a couple intro certs from Google & ISC2 to learn about the field. Then I discovered TryHackMe’s hands-on labs—everything you need to go from zero to hacker in one platform. Who wouldn’t jump at the chance to learn hacking?

🔍  Over the past year, I’ve immersed myself in Penetration Testing & Red Teaming , working through TryHackMe’s learning paths and now closing in on the final Red Teaming modules. This summer I’m targeting the Offensive Security PT1 certification to validate my expertise in web-app pentesting, Active Directory exploits, and network-level attacks.

👇 Here’s what you’ll find on this page:

1. **TryHackMe Profile Card** – Click below to see every task I’ve completed and the skills I’ve earned on TryHackMe.
2. **Completion Certificates** – Each links back to its source for you to dive deeper.
3. **AI & Cloud Pentesting Walkthroughs** – I’ve started with an Intro to AWS Pentesting course and personal write-ups; next up is the full CloudGoat series. Find all walkthroughs under [“Walkthroughs”](/posts)

🌐 Why AI in Cloud? I’m specifically passionate about figuring out how to embed AI into the Red Team's workflow to help automate reconnaissance and vulnerability identification.
