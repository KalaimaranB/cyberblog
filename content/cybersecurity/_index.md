⚡ Going into cybersecurity was truly a chance event - a couple of my friends mentioned the field and I thought I might explore. I started with a couple intro certs from Google & ISC2 to learn about the field. Penetration testing seemed like a pretty fun job so I looked into learning platforms and TryHackMe stood out. A platform built to bring you from zero to a hacker (not just a script kiddie) by teaching everything from analyzing networks to using real tools.

🔍 Over the past year, I've spent many hours workign through TryHackeMe's learning paths and am finally closing in on the final Red Teaming modules. I plan on validating my experience by taking the PT1 (Penetration Testing Level 1) certificatin to show my knowledge on web-app pentesting, Active Directory exploits & network-level attacks.

👇 Here’s what you’ll find on this page:

1. **TryHackMe Profile Card** – Click below to see every task I’ve completed and the skills I’ve earned on TryHackMe.
2. **Completion Certificates** – Each links back to its source for you to dive deeper.
3. **AWS Cloud Pentesting Walkthroughs** – I’ve started with an Intro to AWS Pentesting course and personal write-ups; next up is the full CloudGoat series. Find all walkthroughs [here](/posts).

🌐 My long term goal in this field is to learn about how to integrate AI & Cloud tools to help automate the Penetration Tester's workflow.
