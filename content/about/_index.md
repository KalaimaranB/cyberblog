From a young age, the eventual goal was always to become a doctor. I loved biology, and invested lots of time reading books and learning about the human body, hence the doctor ambition was quite natural. Till late highschool, I was firmly set on this path. 

However, I also started to learn computer programming in elementary school, but it wasn't until high school that I dove deep and taught myself C# and Unity. I started by building small projects & learning early fundamentals of software and game development. Though it started only as a hobby, I learned quickly that I really enjoyed programming, just as much I valued medical science. 

I could not bring myself to choose between the two, which is what led me to Biomedical Engineering at UBC. BMEG allows my to pursue both interests simultaneously: understanding biological systems while using software to simulate and eventually repgoram them. 

My academic focus is in cellular engineering & bioinformatics, particularly in the immunology field. I'm particularly interested in using computational models to predict immune cell reactions to help optimize the synthetic biology. I hope to work in both lab & software projects to help develop technology that can can provide personalized immune-system specific therapeutics. 

In the summer of 2024, I entered a new domain entirely: cybersecurity. What began simply as curiosity (similar to how I got into coding I suppose), it became something I'm devoting considerable time to now. I've earned foundational certifications from ISCÂ² & Google and am working through practical challenges on TryHackMe. I've focused particularly on penetration testing and now among the top 300 users in Canada. 

The two distinct fields - biology & cybersecurity - seem to have similarities at the most fundamental level, a level of symmetry between the two. Just as biological viruses seek out specific receptors, deliver genetic payloads, and exploit the hostâ€™s cellular machinery, malware operates similarly in the digital space â€” scanning for vulnerabilities, executing code, and gaining unauthorized control. Both are systems fundamentally built around threat detection, response & adaptation - perhaps explaining my interest in them both. 

In a way, pursuing these 3 fields show what my underling passion is for: understanding complex systems & buildings tools to make them more adapative to have a positive impact on people. It's the same passion that motivates me to move through these 3 fields as just different paths to reach the same end goal.
