I'm studying Biomedical Engineering at UBC, and I've fallen in love with two completely different fields that are surprisingly similar: Bioinformatics for cellular engineering (think personalized immune cells for treatment) and cybersecurity (specifically penetration testing!).

At UBC, my coursework centers on understanding human biology from an engineering perspective and exploring how software can advance biological research. But well before this, I had gotten into coding by teaching myself C# and Unity back in high school, mainly because I wanted to make games. Nothing fancy â€“ just small projects that taught me the basics of coding.

The cybersecurity world pulled me in pretty recently (only started in 2024 summer). I've picked up certificates from ISCÂ² and Google, and I'm a regular on TryHackMe's challenges. While I've learned about everything from networking to pipeline security, what really gets me going is penetration testing. There's something incredibly satisfying about firing up Kali Linux and grabbing those flags in CTFs, not something I can get learning how to solve differential equations in Calc IV...

What I find most compelling is the remarkable parallel between biology and computer science, particularly the immune system and cybersecurity. Biological viruses carry payloads (their genomes), search for vulnerabilities (typically cell receptors), and commandeer their targets by exploiting the host's cellular machinery. Computer viruses follow a strikingly similar pattern in the digital realm. This symmetry between biological and digital systems continues to fascinate me as I advance in both fields.

This portfolio site is going to host some of the programming projects I've completed as well as my walkthroughs on CyberSecurity topics. Maybe some work on Biomedical Engineering side will pop here soon too (who knows?)
