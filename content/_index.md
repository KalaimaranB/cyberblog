    text: "I recognized a lack of programming opportunities for students during elementary school, which led me to start a programming club at the age of 12. Using Khan Academy as a platform, I taught JavaScript to fellow classmates through weekly sessions. Over time, the club grew to include around 20 students, many of whom developed a genuine interest in coding. I continued the program intermittently throughout high school, with a temporary pause during the COVID-19 pandemic. This early teaching experience evolved into a continued passionâ€”I now serve as a teaching assistant for UBCâ€™s first-year engineering programming course, where I help mentor and guide new students in programming fundamentals."

    text: "In high school, I volunteered with STEMastery, a program focused on developing and delivering STEM education to local elementary schools. As a team lead, I guided a group of students in creating engaging and accessible STEM content, particularly during the shift to remote learning caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This role allowed me to contribute both as a curriculum developer and as a mentor, helping young students explore their interest in science, technology, engineering, and math through interactive learning experiences."

    text: "At UBC, I volunteer with the MEDIC Foundation, an organization committed to community-driven innovation and care, with a focus on supporting seniors across British Columbia. Since joining the IT team in September 2024, I have contributed to the development of a web application designed to connect seniors with volunteers throughout the Lower Mainland. My work has involved both technical implementation and interdisciplinary collaborationâ€”drawing from fields such as psychology to improve user experience. More technical details are available on the software page."

From a young age, the eventual goal was always to become a doctor. I loved biology, and invested lots of time reading books and learning about the human body, hence the doctor ambition was quite natural. Till late highschool, I was firmly set on this path.

However, I also started to learn computer programming in elementary school, but it wasn't until high school that I dove deep and taught myself C# and Unity. I started by building small projects & learning early fundamentals of software and game development. Though it started only as a hobby, I learned quickly that I really enjoyed programming, just as much I valued medical science.

I could not bring myself to choose between the two, which is what led me to Biomedical Engineering at UBC. BMEG allows my to pursue both interests simultaneously: understanding biological systems while using software to simulate and eventually repgoram them.

My academic focus is in cellular engineering & bioinformatics, particularly in the immunology field. I'm particularly interested in using computational models to predict immune cell reactions to help optimize the synthetic biology. I hope to work in both lab & software projects to help develop technology that can can provide personalized immune-system specific therapeutics.

In the summer of 2024, I entered a new domain entirely: cybersecurity. What began simply as curiosity (similar to how I got into coding I suppose), it became something I'm devoting considerable time to now. I've earned foundational certifications from ISCÂ² & Google and am working through practical challenges on TryHackMe. I've focused particularly on penetration testing and now among the top 300 users in Canada.

The two distinct fields - biology & cybersecurity - seem to have similarities at the most fundamental level, a level of symmetry between the two. Just as biological viruses seek out specific receptors, deliver genetic payloads, and exploit the hostâ€™s cellular machinery, malware operates similarly in the digital space â€” scanning for vulnerabilities, executing code, and gaining unauthorized control. Both are systems fundamentally built around threat detection, response & adaptation - perhaps explaining my interest in them both.

In a way, pursuing these 3 fields show what my underling passion is for: understanding complex systems & buildings tools to make them more adapative to have a positive impact on people. It's the same passion that motivates me to move through these 3 fields as just different paths to reach the same end goal.
